Turing Machine Simulator in Java

Originally my 3rd Year CompSci BSc project which I resurrected after Alan Turing hype from a film starring Mr. Cumberbatch,
to share with the community.

Technology: Java / Java2D / Java Swing

Overview
-------------------

VisuTuring is a cross-platform system using Java Technology for simulating computations on Turing Machines. It allows you to create, edit and simulate models of computation and algorithms based on the Turing Machine model which was the brainchild of Alan Turing, a British mathematician known as the Father of Computer Science. All other models of computation provide at most the same computing power as that of Turing Machines, one of the earliest of such models.

VisuTuring makes is easier to learn about Turing Machines, simulate their computation, save and print diagrams and more...

I hope you enjoy using it!
